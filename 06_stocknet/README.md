# StockNet → CPT

> **Status: Demo** — 50 sample records. Full build: ~7,000–9,000 records (88 stocks × ~100 ISO weeks, after filters).

**What it is:** Investor/trader tweets paired with daily OHLCV for the same calendar week. One record = **one (ticker, ISO-week) pair**. Window size: **1 week** (ISO week) — all unique tweets for the week form the text; the 5 daily OHLCV bars for the same week form the timeseries.

**Scale:** 88 S&P-selected stocks across 9 sectors. Tweet window: Jan 2014 – Jan 2016 (~104 ISO weeks per ticker). Unique tweet deduplication and minimum-tweet filter reduce this by ~15–25%.

#### 📄 Text — investor/trader tweets
| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | All unique tweets about the ticker during that ISO week (deduplicated) |
| **Source** | [`yumoxu/stocknet-dataset`](https://github.com/yumoxu/stocknet-dataset) — `tweet/preprocessed/<ticker>/` |
| **Format** | Per-day JSON token arrays (lowercase); script rejoins + detokenises. `@mentions`→`AT_USER`, links→`URL` |
| **`text_quality`** | `"real"` (third-party social media, **not** official first-party text — Charon rule #5; confirm tag) |

#### 📈 Time series — daily OHLCV
| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | The 5 daily price/volume bars for the same ISO week |
| **Source** | Same repo — `price/raw/<ticker>.csv` |
| **Cadence** | `1d`, ~5 steps/week (weeks with < 3 trading days skipped) |

| Channel (`unit`) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `open_usd` | Daily open price (USD) |
| `high_usd` | Daily high price (USD) |
| `low_usd` | Daily low price (USD) |
| `close_usd` | Daily close price (USD) |
| `volume_shares` | Shares traded that day |

> **Note:** tweets and prices are independent sources keyed to the same `(ticker, ISO-week)` — genuine alignment.

**Key issues:**
- **Text quality flag** — tweets are third-party social media, not official first-party text (Charon rule #5). Currently tagged `text_quality: "real"`. Confirm with Charon whether this is acceptable or if a separate tag is needed.
- **Retweet noise** — many tweets are identical retweets; script deduplicates within each week by normalised text. Residual near-duplicate paraphrases remain.
- **AT_USER / URL tokens** — StockNet's preprocessor replaced all @mentions with `AT_USER` and all hyperlinks with `URL`. These placeholder tokens appear verbatim in the emitted text.
- **Token-array format** — preprocessed files store tweet text as a JSON token array (lowercase); script rejoins with basic punctuation detokenisation.
- **Cross-ticker language** — tweets about one stock frequently mention others (e.g. `$AAPL vs $MSFT`); the timeseries is for the primary ticker only.
- **Holiday truncation** — weeks with < 3 trading days are skipped (configurable via `filters.min_trading_days`).
- **High tweet volume** — active tickers produce 30–330 unique tweets per week (AAPL averages ~130). The full text block can become very long. Cap with `filters.max_tweets_per_record: 20` or leave `null` to include all.
- **Sector labelling** — StockTable uses 2014-era sector classifications (e.g. AAPL → "Consumer Goods") which differ from current indices.
